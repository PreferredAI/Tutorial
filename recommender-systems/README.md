# Recommender Systems

This folder contains tutorials, written in Jupyter notebooks, for learning and building recommendation systems.  The tutorials are sorely based on [Cornac](https://cornac.preferred.ai) library.

| Tutorial | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [01_intro.ipynb](01_intro.ipynb)| In this first foray into recommender systems, we explore a popular recommendation dataset called MovieLens, studying its distributions of users, items, and ratings.  We then apply a basic yet commonly effective recommendation strategy based on item popularity. |
| [02_neighborhood.ipynb](02_neighborhood.ipynb)| Here, we explore a simple, yet highly intuitive collaborative filtering approach that is based on the concept of neighborhood.  Not only does this approach clearly illustrate the collaborative filtering notion of bridging users and items by finding simmilarities, but it also lends itself to interpretability as we will see in this tutorial. |
