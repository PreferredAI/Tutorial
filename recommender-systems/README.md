# Recommender Systems

This folder contains tutorials, written in Jupyter notebooks, for learning and building recommendation systems.  The tutorials are sorely based on [Cornac](https://cornac.preferred.ai) library.

| Tutorial | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [01_intro.ipynb](01_intro.ipynb) | In this first foray into recommender systems, we explore a popular recommendation dataset called MovieLens, studying its distributions of users, items, and ratings.  We then apply a basic yet commonly effective recommendation strategy based on item popularity. |
| [02_neighborhood.ipynb](02_neighborhood.ipynb) | One basis for recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering, where we use the historical rating behaviors to find similarities across users and/or items in arriving at the rating predictions.  Here, we explore a simple, yet highly intuitive collaborative filtering approach that is based on the concept of neighborhood.  Not only does this approach clearly illustrate the collaborative filtering notion of bridging users and items by finding simmilarities, but it also lends itself to interpretability as we will see in this tutorial. |
| [03_matrix_factorization.ipynb](03_matrix_factorization.ipynb) | One apt abstraction for the ratings that users assign to items is a matrix. Most of the time, the rating matrix we observe is very sparse. The challenge then is how to fill in the missing values as accurately as possible.  If we assume that most matrices have a low-rank representation (it can be reconstructed from relatively few basis vectors), then one promising approach is to conduct matrix factorization.  Indeed, matrix factorization is a cornerstone of many recommendation algorithms. |
| [04_implicit_feedback.ipynb](04_implicit_feedback.ipynb) | There are two types of feedback on which most recommender systems would be based. Explicit feedback deals with clear and quantified expression of preferences by a user, in terms of both likes and dislikes. An excellent example would be ratings. However, much more common is implicit feedback, where users provide some positive signals, but the contrast to negative signals may be absent or at least much less evident. An example would be clicks on links or views when browsing.  In this tutorial, we will focus on implicit feedback. |
